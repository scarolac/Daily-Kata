 * <b>Description: </b> Broken Strings
 * Given a string s and an integer k, break up the string into multiple lines such 
 * that each line has a length of k or less. You must break it up so that words don't 
 * break across lines. Each line has to have the maximum possible amount of words. 
 * If there's no way to break the text up, then return empty list.
 * 
 * You can assume that there are no spaces at the ends of the string and that there 
 * is exactly one space between each word.
 * 
 * For example, given the string "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and k = 10, 
 * you should return: ["the quick", "brown fox", "jumps over", "the lazy", "dog"]. 
 * No string in the list has a length of more than 10.
