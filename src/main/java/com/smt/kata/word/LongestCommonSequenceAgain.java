 * <b>Description: </b> Longest Common Sequence Again Kata
 *  
 * Write a program that computes the length of the longest common subsequence of 
 * a variable number of given strings. For example, given "epidemiologist", "refrigeration", 
 * and "believingmore", it should return "eieio" since that is the longest common subsequence.
 * 
 * The sequences are case sensitive.  The sequences do not need to be sequntial,
 * though they must be in order.
 * 
 * Another Example
 * Given: "bat", "hat", "cat"
 * Return: "at"
