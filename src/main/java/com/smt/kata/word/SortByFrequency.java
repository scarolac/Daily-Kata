 * <b>Description: </b> Sort Characters By Frequency Kata
 * 
 * Given a string s, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of the 
 * characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.
 * 
 * Return the sorted string in reverse order of the count
 * 
 * Example 1
 * input "HelloWorld"
 * output: "lordewh"
 * explanation: When grouped the counts are:
 * l : 3
 * o : 2
 * r : 1
 * d : 1
 * e : 1
 * w : 1
 * h : 1
 * 
 * For elements with the same count, the order does not matter
 * 
 * ----- NOTE: This must be accomplished as a single line code.
