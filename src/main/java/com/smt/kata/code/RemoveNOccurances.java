/**
 * Given a list and a number, create a new list that contains each number of list
 * at most N times, without reordering.  For example if the input number is 2, 
 * and the input list is [1,2,3,1,2,1,2,3], you take [1,2,3,1,2], drop the next 
 * [1,2] since this would lead to 1 and 2 being in the result 3 times, and then
 * take 3, which leads to [1,2,3,1,2,3].  With list [20,37,20,21] and number 1, 
 * the result would be [20,37,21].
 * 
 * Results:
 * removeOccurances should always return an array, empty if validation fails.
 * 
 * validation:
 * data should not be null
 * maxOccurances should not be negative.
